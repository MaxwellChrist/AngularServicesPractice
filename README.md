This project is to get some practice understanding and implementing services and dependency injection. I want something that I can reference back to at a later time if I'm struggling with services or dependency injection in the future. For that reason, this project will not focus on building a fully polished app. It will not contain testing, detailed CSS, etc. but instead highlight the main best practices and understanding of how to use these Angular features.
